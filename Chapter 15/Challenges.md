### Challenge 1: Adding raw values
#### Take the coin example from earlier in the chapter then begin with the following array of coins:
```
enum Coin: Int {
  case penny = 1
  case nickel = 5
  case dime = 10
  case quarter = 25
}

let coinPurse: [Coin] = [.penny, .quarter, .nickel, .dime, .penny, .dime, .quarter]
```
#### Write a function where you can pass in the array of coins, add up the value and then return the number of cents.
```
enum Coin: Int {
  case penny = 1
  case nickel = 5
  case dime = 10
  case quarter = 25
}

let coinPurse: [Coin] = [.penny, .quarter, .nickel, .dime, .penny, .dime, .quarter]

func returnCoins(myCoins:[Coin]) -> Int{
    var raws = 0
    
    for x in myCoins{
        raws += x.rawValue
    }
    
    return raws
}
```
### Challenge 2: Computing with raw values
#### Take the example from earlier in the chapter and begin with the Month enumeration:
```
enum Month: Int {
  case january = 1, february, march, april, may, june, july,
       august, september, october, november, december
}
```
#### Write a computed property to calculate the number of months until summer.
#### Hint: Youâ€™ll need to account for a negative value if summer has already passed in the current year.
#### To do that, imagine looping back around for the next full year.
```
enum Month: Int {
    case january = 1, february, march, april, may, june, july,
    august, september, october, november, december
    var numberOfmonthsTillSummer:Int {
        return abs(Month.june.rawValue - self.rawValue)
    }
}
```
### Challenge 3: Pattern matching enumeration values
#### Take the map example from earlier in the chapter and begin with the Direction enumeration:
```
enum Direction {
  case north
  case south
  case east
  case west
}
```
#### Imagine starting a new level in a video game. 
#### The character makes a series of movements in the game.
#### Calculate the position of the character on a top-down level map after making a set of movements:
```
let movements: [Direction] = [.north, .north, .west, .south,
  .west, .south, .south, .east, .east, .south, .east]
```
#### Hint: Use a tuple for the location:
```
var location = (x: 0, y: 0)
```
```
for coordinates in movements {
  switch coordinates {
  case .north:
    location.y += 1
  case .south:
    location.y -= 1
  case .east:
    location.x += 1
  case .west:
    location.x -= 1
  }
}
```
