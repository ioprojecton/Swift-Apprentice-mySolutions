### Create a string constant called firstName and initialize it to your first name.
### Also create a string constant called lastName and initialize it to your last name.

```

let firstName = "Surepic"

let lastName = "Pluto"

```

### Create a string constant called fullName by adding the firstName and lastName constants together, separated by a space.

```

let firstName = "Surepic"

let lastName = "Pluto"

let fullName = firstName + " " + lastName

```

### Using interpolation, create a string constant called myDetails that uses the fullName constant to create a 
### string introducing yourself. For example, my string would read: "Hello, my name is Matt Galloway.".‚Äù

```

let firstName = "Surepic"

let lastName = "Pluto"

let fullName = firstName + " " + lastName

let myDetails = "Hello, my name is \(fullName)"


```
