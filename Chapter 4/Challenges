###Challenge 1: How many times
####In the following for loop, what will be the value of sum, and how many iterations will happen?
```
var sum = 0
for i in 0...5 {
  sum += i
}
///6 times, sum = 15
```
###Challenge 2: Count the letter
####In the while loop below, how many instances of “a” will there be in aLotOfAs? 
####Hint: aLotOfAs.count tells you how many characters are in the string aLotOfAs.
```
var aLotOfAs = ""
while aLotOfAs.count < 10 {
  aLotOfAs += "a"
}
//10 times.
```

###Challenge 3: What will print
####Consider the following switch statement:
```
switch coordinates {
case let (x, y, z) where x == y && y == z:
  print("x = y = z")
case (_, _, 0):
  print("On the x/y plane")
case (_, 0, _):
  print("On the x/z plane")
case (0, _, _):
  print("On the y/z plane")
default:
  print("Nothing special")
}
```
####What will this code print when coordinates is each of the following?
```
let coordinates = (1, 5, 0)//On the x/y plane
let coordinates = (2, 2, 2)//x = y = z
let coordinates = (3, 0, 1)//On the x/z plane
let coordinates = (3, 2, 5)//Nothing special
let coordinates = (0, 2, 4)//On the y/z plane
```
###Challenge 4: Closed range size
####A closed range can never be empty. Why?
```
It needs 2 numbers to work ... closed range has start point and end point and is always increasing.
```

###Challenge 5: The final countdown
####Print a countdown from 10 to 0.
####(Note: do not use the reversed() method, which will be introduced later.)

```
var counter = 10

while counter > 0{
    print(counter)
    counter -= 1
}
```

###Challenge 6: Print a sequence
####Print 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0.
####(Note: do not use the stride(from:by:to:) function, which will be introduced later.)

```
var counter:Double = 0

while counter < 1{
    print(counter)
    counter += 0.1
}
```
