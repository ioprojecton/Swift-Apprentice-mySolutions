#### Write a function named printFullName that takes two strings called firstName and lastName.
#### The function should print out the full name defined as firstName + " " + lastName.
#### Use it to print out your own full name.
```
func printFullName(firstName: String, lastName: String){
    print(firstName + " " + lastName)
}
```

#### Change the declaration of printFullName to have no external name for either parameter.
```
func printFullName(_ firstName: String, _ lastName: String){
    print(firstName + " " + lastName)
}
```

#### Write a function named calculateFullName that returns the full name as a string.
#### Use it to store your own full name in a constant.
```
func calculateFullName(firstName: String, lastName: String) -> String {
    firstName + " " + lastName
}

let me = calculateFullName(firstName:"Surepic", lastName:"Pluto")
```

#### Change calculateFullName to return a tuple containing both the full name and the length of the name.
#### You can find a stringâ€™s length by using the count property.
#### Use this function to determine the length of your own full name.
```
func calculateFullName(firstName: String, lastName: String) -> (String,Int) {
    return (firstName + " " + lastName,(firstName + " " + lastName).count)
}
```
